# Stock Price Prediction With LSTM

In this repository, I will create a machine learning algorithm to predict the stock price (Adjusted Close) and make a trading recommendation for the user.

The LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) algorithm will be used. This is a popular algorithms for stock prediction.

The goal is to create an algorithm which can predict the stock prices with a tolerance of Â± 5%. Also, I want to show how the different stock categories influence the accuracy of the algorithm.

The following stock categories will be analyzed:
- Blue chip stocks: Blue chip stocks are shares of large, established companies with stable financial performance and low risk.
   - BMW (BMW.DE)
- Growth stocks: growth stocks are stocks of companies with high potential for future growth. These stocks often carry higher risks, but also offer higher potential returns
    - Tesla, Inc. (TSLA)
    - Bitcoin (BTC-USD)
- Dividend stocks: dividend stocks are stocks of companies that pay regular dividends to their shareholders. These stocks often carry lower risks and offer a regular source of income.
    - Johnson & Johnson (JNJ)
- Small-cap stocks: small-cap stocks are stocks of small companies with higher risk and higher potential for growth and return.
    - Etsy, Inc (ETSY)

# Technical Concepts

- Why does it exist?
- Frame your project for the potential user. 
- Compare/contrast your project with other, similar projects so the user knows how it is different from those projects.
- Highlight the technical concepts that your project demonstrates or supports. Keep it very brief.
- Keep it useful.

# Getting Started
Include any essential instructions for:
- Getting it
- Installing It
- Configuring It
- Running it

# More Specific Topics (+ sample sub-categories)
- Versioning: Services, APIs, Systems
- Common Error Messages/related details
- Tests

# Findings
Growth stocks and the small-cap stocks are worse than blue-chip and dividend stocks in their performance.


# Further Informations
- Next Step: Create a WebApp with Flask for the user
- Bugs: 
   - it is not possible to create an pickle file for the ML model

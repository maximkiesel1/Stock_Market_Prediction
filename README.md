# Introduction

In this repository, I will create a machine learning algorithm to predict the stock price (Adjusted Close) and make a trading recommendation for the user.

The LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) algorithm will be used. This is a popular algorithm for stock prediction.

The goal is to create an algorithm that can predict stock prices with a tolerance of Â± 5%. I also want to show how the different stock categories affect the accuracy of the algorithm.

The following stock categories will be analyzed
- Blue chip stocks: Blue chip stocks are stocks of large, established companies with stable financial performance and low risk.
   - BMW (BMW.DE)
   
- Growth stocks: Growth stocks are stocks of companies with high potential for future growth. These stocks often carry higher risks, but also offer higher potential returns.
    - Tesla, Inc. (TSLA)
    - Bitcoin (BTC-USD)
   
- Dividend stocks: Dividend stocks are stocks of companies that pay regular dividends to their shareholders. These stocks are often less risky and provide a regular source of income.
    - Johnson & Johnson (JNJ)
    
- Small-cap stocks: Small-cap stocks are stocks of small companies with higher risk and higher potential for growth and return.
    - Etsy, Inc (ETSY)

# Technical Concepts

This project involves the following technical concepts:

- Used API: The Yahoo Finance API was used to collect historical stock prices data.
   - Using always the last three years to the present date for the training.

- Predicting Stock Prices: The aim of the project is to predict the Adjusted Close stock price for 7, 14, and 28 days in the future.
   - Allowing 3 Stocks for prediction, because of the long training duration
   - 20 randowm iteration with different hyperparameter: 
      - Hyperparameters: `params = {
        'window_size': [4, 8, 12, 20],
        'lstm_units': [16, 32, 64, 128],
        'dense_units': [16, 32, 64, 128],
        'learning_rate': [0.0001, 0.001, 0.01, 0.1]}`
   - Training 200 epochs 

- Accuracy: The model is designed to achieve an accuracy of approximately +-5%.

- Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) LSTM: In order to achieve the prediction task, the project uses Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) in form of the LSTM algorithm with the Keras deep learning library. LSTM is particularly suited for processing sequential data, making them a good fit for predicting stock prices. The Keras library provides an easy-to-use interface for building and training deep learning models.

# Directory Structure

The package has the following directory structure:

 - data
   - `process_data.py`
   - `cleaned_data_sql.db`
  - models
    - keras_model
    - `modelling.py`
    - visual_predict
    - visual_validation

You can find the technical analyses for the code in the Jupyter notebooks. 

# How to use the program

To use the package, follow these steps:

- Clone the repository to your local machine.

Please ensure that the libraries from the requirements.txt file are installed on your system before running the code. If any of these libraries are missing, you can install them using pip. For example, to install the pandas library, you can use the following command:

```
pip install pandas
```

- GET THE DATA: Navigate to the `data` folder and run `python process_data.py`. This will start a input box to write the desired stock names (acronym) and  get the historical data automaticlly from the yahoo API, clean the data, and save the resulting data in a SQL database called `cleaned_data_sql.db`.
  - Here is an example to run the program:

# Findings
Growth stocks and the small-cap stocks are worse than blue-chip and dividend stocks in their performance.

# Further Informations
- Next Step: Create a WebApp with Flask for the user
- Bugs: 
   - It is not possible to create an pickle file for the ML model
   - While training the model, this error messages appears (without an impact):
      - `WARNING:absl:Found untraced functions such as lstm_cell_68_layer_call_fn, lstm_cell_68_layer_call_and_return_conditional_losses while saving (showing 2 of 2). These functions will not be directly callable after loading.`
   - For stock abbreviations with a hyphen like "BCT-USD" and a sql data bank with my code has already been created once, then the database must be deleted manually, otherwise this stock entry cannot be deleted via my code. All other shares will be deleted automatically when restarting the code.
